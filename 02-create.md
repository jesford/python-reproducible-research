> * Demonstrate ability to initialize a Git repository, and push commits to GitHub.
> * Use sufficient documentation so that someone can reproduce your analysis.

Doing research in a reproducible way takes practice, so let's get started! We will be working in groups of two for this activity. Please make sure you have both downloaded the [dataset](). You and your partner will be assigned one of three questions to investigate with this data. You have complete freedom to choose the form for your methods and final result, but you will need to share these things in a public GitHub repository. Your goal is to make your analysis easy for another group to understand and reproduce.

> Your instructor will assign you one of the following tasks:
> * Topic A: assignment
> * Topic B: assignment
> * Topic C: assignment

> Start out by deciding on a name for your project, and create a new public GitHub
> repository for it. Then start exploring your topic using this dataset, and try
> to document your choices and process as you work.

Now that we have all investigated one of the topics using this dataset, we are going to swap projects and attempt to reproduce results. You will be working with the same partner, but you should switch "drivers" so that the other person is typing on the laptop.
