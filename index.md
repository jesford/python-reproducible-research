title: Reproducible Research
---
Being able to reproduce results (whether they are from someone else or your own past self) is important for the progress of science. Making the steps and materials of a research project public, and easy to understand, allows scientists to build off of previous work to create new scientific breakthroughs faster. This lesson is a short exercise in creating a reproducible work flow, which should generate discussion on best practices and some difficulties that come up in practice. 

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> Learners should have already covered basic programming in 
> Python, and version control with Git and GitHub, at the level of 
> [python-novice-inflammation](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) 
> and [git-novice](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Some experience 
> with research will help learners get the most out of the discussions, but is 
> not required.

> ## Getting ready {.getready}
>
> Nothing to do, you are ready to go!
